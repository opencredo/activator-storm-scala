        <h2>Apache Storm, Hazelcast and Scala</h2>
        <p>This tutorial is a Scala-based, real-time word count example, using Apache Storm.
            The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how Scala can be used with ease to implement Storm components,
            thanks to its easy to use Java-interoperability capabilities.</p>
        <p>This tutorial contains two Storm topologies: one that uses in-memory maps and stateful dispatching to process and store
            word counts, while the other uses Hazelcast as an in-memory data grid.</p>
        <h3>Apache Storm</h3>
        <p>Apache Storm is distributed, scalable and fault-tolerant open source real-time computation system. Storm has a simple API to create
            graphs of distributed components, called topologies.</p>
        <p>One of the core abstractions in Storm is the concept of a stream, which is an unbounded sequence of tuples.
            Each stream starts with a component called a spout that is responsible of emitting data tuples into the stream.
            The spout is typically combined with any number of bolts to process and transform the data.</p>
        <p>In this tutorial, we have one stream where the <code>RandomSentenceGeneratorSpout</code> emits continuously random sentences from
            a local set. Each sentence is split into individual words by the <code>SplitSentenceBolt</code> and then passed on
            to either <code>HazelcastWordCountBolt</code> or <code>InMemoryWordCountBolt</code> for counting and persistence.</p>
        <h3>Hazelcast</h3>
        <p>Hazelcast is a scalable Java-based open source in-memory data grid. Hazelcast offers a number of distributed
            data structures through a simple API that should be familiar to those who worked with Java collections.</p>
        <p>In this tutorial, we use a map from Hazelcast to store a counter for each word. Because Hazelcast is distributed,
            there is no need to use field grouping in the storm topology; hence shuffle grouping is used. It is also worth noting
            that Hazelcast survives shutdown of the Storm cluster, which allows us to examine the final results
            at the end of <code>StormAppHazelcast</code> at after shutdown.</p>
